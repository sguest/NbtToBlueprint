# NbtToBlueprint

Simple utility that converts from Minecraft .nbt structure files to the blueprint format used on the minecraft wiki.

Allows for easy publishing of blueprints to the wiki.

In theory contains general-purpose NBT decoder and deserializer, though these have not been rigorously tested and only been used for decoding specific structure files.
